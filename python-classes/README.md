## Description of project
Classes and objects in Python allow you to create models to represent real-world concepts or entities in a simplified manner. A class is like a blueprint or a plan for creating objects, while an object is a specific instance of that class.

This directory contains several Python files that implement a `Square` class to represent squares. Each file corresponds to a different version of the implementation, with added or modified functionalities as we progress.

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Documentation is now mandatory! Each module, class, and method must contain docstring as comments

## Files
- **0-square.py**: Implements an empty `Square` class.
- **1-square.py**: Adds basic initialization with the square's size.
- **2-square.py**: Introduces size validation to ensure it's positive.
- **3-square.py**: Adds a method to compute the square's area.
- **4-square.py**: Introduces the ability to modify the square's size.
- **5-square.py**: Adds a method to display the square using the '#' character.
- **6-square.py**: Implements a special method to make the class more user-friendly.
